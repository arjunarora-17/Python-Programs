## Number-to-amount-in-words

### USE üë®‚Äçüíª ##
 This program converts any number (in range [1, 999999999]) in its representation in words.<br>
 For Example : **14536** -> **fourteen thousand five hundred thirty six**.

### HOW IT WORKS :question: ##
* The catch is, all the numbers follow almost the same trend with just some diffrences.
* For example *six***teen** and *six***ty**. So there are separate dictonaries for both "**teen** and **ty**" and "*six*"
* Also for some exceptions like "eleven", "twelve", a direct condition has been added.
* In order to make the system uniform, a function is added which converts number of digits of the given input to a particular value (which is further evaluated by the function) by adding a zero in the begining.
* Using the amalgamation of **loops**, **if-else**, **methods** and **dictonaries** it's an instance of a working python program.
